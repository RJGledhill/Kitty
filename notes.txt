KITTY

Quick test simulator to sketch out some ideas and structure of how a market simulator / trading software system would work
Not playing with real market data, but with an invented fascimile.

All stock data etc. in the form of sqlite3 databases.  Alphas too.


Programs:

(1) marketDataInventor
	- A market M is made of N sectors, each divided into S stocks.
	- The market is a brownian noise function added to a forcing function (e.g. has a steady upward slope over time) and has a prescribed volatility
	- Each individual sector is in long term growth or decline and has a prescribed volatility (the market volatility multiplied by a constant
	- Each individual stock has a volatility (the sector volatility multiplied by a constant)
	- Step 1: create a market vector
  - Step 2: plot graphs out for a visible report html page.

-- Later on, start adding some sort of correlated version together.

NEXT UP:

* Calculate realised volatility (the square root of realised variance: see wikipedia for this) -- adjusted to give an annualised number
